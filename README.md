# PomoDuino
A physical, open source pomodoro timer.
<h3>Why I made this:</h3>
It's a physical arduino pomodoro timer what's cooler than that! A pomodoro timer is a method of getting work done that uses a series of work sessions, short breaks, & long breaks to maximize efficiency when studying! I used lots of different web ones, but those were clunky and kept resetting my progress whenever I accidentally reloaded the page so this is a fix to that!
